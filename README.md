# Application of GraphQL in React

## Mandatory

### Objectives

To kickstart the development of your Rick and Morty application using Next.js, you will set up a new project with:

- **TypeScript**: For static type checking and improved developer experience.
- **ESLint**: To maintain code quality and consistency.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid and customizable UI development.

This setup will provide a solid foundation for integrating GraphQL and building a modern React application.
